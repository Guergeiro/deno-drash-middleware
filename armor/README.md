Armor helps secure your Drash applications through headers. Inspired by [helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet). It is configurable and can be used throughout the request-resource-response lifecycle.

Armor will set extra HTTP headers to the request response, to aid in securing your application. This does not make your application bulletproof, but adds extra security layers.

```typescript
import { Drash } from "https://deno.land/x/drash@{version}/mod.ts";

// Import the Armor middleware function
import { Armor } from "https://deno.land/x/drash-middleware@{version}/armor/mod.ts";

// Instantiate armor
const armor = Armor();

// Create your server and plug in armor to the middleware config
const server = new Drash.Http.Server({
  resources: [
    HomeResource,
  ],
  middleware: {
    after_request: [
      armor
    ]
  }
});

server.run({
  hostname: "localhost",
  port: 1447,
});

console.log(`Server running at ${server.hostname}:${server.port}`);
```

## Configuration

Armor has a list of default headers it will set, when `Armor` is called with no arguments, but you can override these.

### `X-XSS-Protection`

This header does not protect against XSS attacks, but only protects against *one type* of XSS attack.

See here for more information: https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/xss-filter/

- [x] Enabled by default?

```typescript
const armor = Armor() // Set by default
const armor = Armor({
  "X-XSS-Protection": false // Disable it
})
```

### `Referrer-Policy`

The Referrer-Policy header is usually set by browsers to tell a server where it's coming from.

See here for more information: https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/referrer-policy/

- [ ] Enabled by default?

```typescript
const armor = Armor() // Will not set the header
const armor = Armor({
  "Referrer-Policy": "no-origin" // Enable it, and set it to "no-origin"
})
```

See [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/referrer-policy/#referrer-policies) for all possible policies.

### `X-Content-Type-Options`

The Referrer-Policy header is used to tell browsers not to sniff the mime type. Browsers will trust what the server says and block the resource if itâ€™s wrong.

See here for more information: https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/dont-sniff-mimetype/

- [x] Enabled by default?

```typescript
const armor = Armor() // Set by default
const armor = Armor({
  "X-Content-Type-Options": false // Disable it
})
```

### `Strict-Transport-Security`

The Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header is used to tell browsers to stick with HTTPS and never visit the HTTP version.

See here for more information: https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/hsts/

- [x] Enabled by default?

```typescript
const armor = Armor() // Set by default to 60 days and include sub domains
const armor = Armor({
  hsts: {
    maxAge: false // Disable the header altogether
  }
})
const armor = Armor({
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 5184000 // Enable HSTS and set a max age
  }
})
const armor = Armor({
  hsts: {
    includeSubDomains: false // Enable default max age but disable the inclusion of sub domains
  }
})
const armor = Armor({
  hsts: {
    includeSubDomains: true // Can set to true, but it's set by default
  }
})
const armor = Armor({
  hsts: {
    preload: true // Defaults to false
  }
})
```
